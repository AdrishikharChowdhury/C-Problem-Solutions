There is a girl I like from my class. She has curly short hair and wears glasses and she is the most tomboy girl anyone can find. We
always laughed and joked about how any boy could even flirt with her or fall in love. Sometimes she makes the silliest and unfunniest
jokes possible but somehow I found it the most funniest and laugh like a mad man. Even though we never flirted with each other I think
I am starting to like her and that girl's name is Tanisha Bitch (ECE).
