## Introduction

Welcome to my collection of C programming problem solutions. This repository serves as a personal archive of my journey through various coding challenges and algorithm problems. Each solution is implemented in C and includes detailed comments explaining the approach, time and space complexity, and any key concepts used.

The problems solved here range from basic algorithmic challenges to more complex data structure implementations and advanced algorithmic puzzles. This collection not only showcases my problem-solving skills but also serves as a resource for others learning C programming or preparing for coding interviews.

Topics covered in this repository include, but are not limited to:
- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Bit Manipulation
- Math and Logic Puzzles

## How to Use

1. Browse through the repository to find a problem you're interested in.
2. Each solution file contains:
   - The problem statement in comments at the top
   - The solution code
   - Explanatory comments throughout the code
   - Time and space complexity analysis
3. Feel free to use these solutions as a reference or for learning purposes.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run a C program:

    bash
    gcc -o program_name file_name.c
    ./program_name

Replace program_name with your desired executable name and `file_name.c` with the source file name.
Some problems may require additional compilation flags or linking to libraries. In such cases, specific compilation instructions will be provided in the file's comments.

# Contributing
